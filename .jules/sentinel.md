## 2026-01-31 - [Stored XSS in Static Site Generator]
**Vulnerability:** The static site generator injected file content from `.txt` files, titles, and filenames directly into HTML templates without escaping.
**Learning:** Even if a library (like `markdown-it`) handles some escaping, the surrounding template code must also sanitize all user inputs (titles, filenames, custom text processing).
**Prevention:** Always escape user-controlled data before inserting it into HTML templates. Use a context-aware escaping function or a template engine that handles escaping automatically.

## 2026-02-21 - [Reflected XSS in Stylesheet Injection]
**Vulnerability:** The `options.style` input was injected directly into the `href` attribute of a `<link>` tag without escaping, allowing for XSS attacks via crafted stylesheet paths.
**Learning:** Reusing existing security functions (`escapeHtml`) is critical but requires vigilance to ensure they are applied to *all* injection points, not just content body.
**Prevention:** Audit all variables interpolated into HTML templates and ensure output encoding is applied.
## 2026-02-28 - [XSS Fix]
**Vulnerability:** Unescaped style attribute in HTML template.
**Learning:** Even internal configuration/argument inputs to templates must be escaped to prevent arbitrary code execution if inputs can be controlled by users.
**Prevention:** Always wrap variables injected into HTML attributes with an HTML escaping function.
